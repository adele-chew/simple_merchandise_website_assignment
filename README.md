# simple_merchandise_website_assignment
A website development assignment using HTML, JS, and PHP to create a plain shopping website revolving around shoes. No CSS implemented as it was not necessary to the assignment.

Functions include login, catalogue pages, a shopping cart function, staff and member privileges, and simple static about me pages. 

Unfortunately, the shopping cart page is not fully functional.
